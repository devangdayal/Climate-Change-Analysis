<em><p>Climate change is the long-term alteration of temperature and typical weather patterns in a place. Climate change could refer to a particular location or the planet as a whole. Climate change may cause weather patterns to be less predictable.</p></em>

## Project Info
<p>In this project, We will be performing Exploratory Data Analysis. We will be using the Temperature Variation Dataset of Earth to analyse, observe and develop a model to predict the climate change across the globe.

## Dataset Information
<p> The Dataset Chosen for this Project is from <a href="http://berkeleyearth.org/archive/about/"><b>Berkeley Earth</b></a>.
<br>Berkeley Earth supplies comprehensive open-source world air pollution data and highly user-accessible global temperature data that is timely, impartial, and verified.</p>
<p>Given this complexity, there are a range of organizations that collate climate trends data. The three most cited land and ocean temperature data sets are NOAA’s MLOST, NASA’s GISTEMP and the UK’s HadCrut.

We have repackaged the data from a newer compilation put together by the Berkeley Earth, which is affiliated with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Study combines 1.6 billion temperature reports from 16 pre-existing archives. It is nicely packaged and allows for slicing into interesting subsets (for example by country). They publish the source data and the code for the transformations they applied. They also use methods that allow weather observations from shorter time series to be included, meaning fewer observations need to be thrown away.

In this dataset, we have include several files:

* Global Land and Ocean-and-Land Temperatures (GlobalTemperatures.csv):
  
  - Date: starts in 1750 for average land temperature and 1850 for max and min land temperatures and global ocean and land temperatures
  - LandAverageTemperature: global average land temperature in celsius
  - LandAverageTemperatureUncertainty: the 95% confidence interval around the average
  - LandMaxTemperature: global average maximum land temperature in celsius
  - LandMaxTemperatureUncertainty: the 95% confidence interval around the maximum land temperature
  - LandMinTemperature: global average minimum land temperature in celsius
  - LandMinTemperatureUncertainty: the 95% confidence interval around the minimum land temperature
  - LandAndOceanAverageTemperature: global average land and ocean temperature in celsius
  - LandAndOceanAverageTemperatureUncertainty: the 95% confidence interval around the global average land and ocean temperature
