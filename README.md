<em><p>Climate change is the long-term alteration of temperature and typical weather patterns in a place. Climate change could refer to a particular location or the planet as a whole. Climate change may cause weather patterns to be less predictable.</p></em>

## Project Info
<p>In this project, We will be performing Exploratory Data Analysis. We will be using the Temperature Variation Dataset of Earth to analyse, observe and develop a model to predict the climate change across the globe.
